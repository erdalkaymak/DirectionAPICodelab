<p>
	HMS Core Map SDK is a set of APIs for map development in Android. The map data covers most countries outside China and supports multiple languages. The Map SDK uses the WGS 84 GPS coordinate system, which can meet most requirements of map development outside China. You can easily add map-related functions in your Android app, including:
  <ul>
	<li>	Map display: Displays buildings, roads, water systems, and Points of Interest (POIs).</li>
	<li>Map interaction: Controls the interaction gestures and buttons on the map.</li>
	<li>	Map drawing: Ads location markers, map layers, overlays, and various shapes.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h2>
